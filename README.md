# SOC-Eye 

A Minimal SOC-Style Live Monitoring & Alerting Tool (Pure Bash)

# overview

SOC-Eye is a lightweight, Bash-based script that simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) eye-on-glass experience.
It continuously monitors system and IDS logs in real-time, extracts indicators of compromise (IoCs), and raises alerts with severity-based color coding.

Perfect for students, SOC interns, or anyone who wants to get hands-on with log analysis, threat detection, and SOC-style monitoring‚Äîwithout needing heavy SIEM tools.
